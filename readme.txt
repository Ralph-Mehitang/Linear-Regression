The executable project1 runs with the argument points100.dat

This project was pretty tough at first. what was hard for me at first was finding the inverse of a given matrix. I struggled 
particularly when it came to properly splitting the matrices and reassembling them getting seg faults that had to deal with me allocating one of my my matrices to a matrix that had nothing in it. The problem 
turns out was from my default constructor overwriting the values. Once I got that working as inverse is the base of the entire project everything else fell into place. Timing wise every time is included in the output for your viewing.

Bonus wise I included an issymetric funciton but as I was running out of time I sadly did not get a chance to test it
